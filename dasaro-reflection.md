-What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  I was struggling with dealing with merge conflicts prior to the GPS session. It took a long time to figure out how to resolve the conflict without deleting the repository and starting over.
-What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  The concept of git fetch and git merge were the same as git pull to me before the GPS session. Joey helped me realize that git fetch and git merge were a 2-step command, and that git pull was a command that included both of those steps.
-What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  I asked questions regarding how to delete or close a pull request when it was made to the wrong corporation. I also asked about commit messages while using git and the necessary protocol.
-What still confuses you about Git?
  I feel like there are still a lot of things to explore with Git. One thing that I still feel a little confused about is shortening the commands by personalizing the commands. For instance: instead of typing "git checkout", I read that it was possible to type "git co". I need to do more research on this topic.
-How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  I really enjoyed my GPS session, even though I was the solo cohort member. However, I still got the chance to drive and navigate which allowed me to feel the excitement and pressure present when working with others. I really liked the feedback and encouragement as well! :)
